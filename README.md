**Life Expectancy Project**

This project aims to analyze and predict life expectancy based on various factors such as country, adult mortality , infant deaths , alcoholism , percentage expenditure, hepatitis B Measles , BMI , under five deaths,polio, HIV/AIDS , thinness 1-19years , income resources , schooling . I explored different statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques to gain insights into the trends and patterns of life expectancy across different regions and demographic groups.

**Data**
I use publicly available data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other sources to develop our predictive models. The data includes information on life expectancy, health indicators, socio-economic factors, and environmental factors for different countries and regions.

**Methods**
I applied various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering methods, and model selection strategies to develop our predictive models. I evaluate the performance of our models using R-square  technique ( Independent variable explains the variance of dependent feature)  and measure their accuracy using RMSE metric.

**Results**
I present the results of my analysis in the form of  interactive visualizations. I compare the performance of different models and highlight the factors that have the most significant impact on life expectancy.

**Conclusion**
My project provides valuable insights into the factors that influence life expectancy and offers a robust predictive model that can be used to estimate life expectancy for different populations. The results of this project could have significant implications for public health policies, healthcare interventions, and personalized medicine.

**Dependencies**
The project requires the following libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Usage
To run the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Then run the life_expectancy.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis and results. The notebook includes detailed explanations and code for each step of the analysis.

**Credits**
This project was created by Samhita Kolichala  as part of project at Bombay Stock Exchange . I thank Indrani Sen Mam for her guidance and support.
